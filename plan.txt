  - a mage does a ritual makes him the strongest being
  - but it summons an immortal revenant which hunts him down
  - you plays as the revenant overcoming the obstacles the mage has prepared

player attacks:
  rotating knives:
  - u have a circle of knives which rotate around u
  - passive damage to enemies around you
  - LMB to throw a knife which depletes one of them
  - knives depleted spawn back every 1 second 2
  - hold RMB to make it rotate faster (charge them up) for more damage and speed
  - if u charge spin knives dont spawn back
 
  dash
  - dash and deal damage to enemies u pass
  
  tp mark
  - spend a knife to mark current position
  - you can then activate to dash back to last mark
  - this also deals damage to enemies u pass
  - you can have multiple marks
  - u dash back to the last one u placed
  - u can them do setups and spam dash back multiples times
  
  chain
  - when u throw a knife it has a chain which is like rope/hook
  - if u can then hold space to swing around: https://vv4t.github.io/demo/floating_pain
  - chains that pass through enemies deal damage
  
  kinetic blast:
  - shoot out all knives in every direction
  - damage and speed is scaled on player velocity
